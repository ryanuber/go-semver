go-semver
=========

* No panics at runtime
* SemVer 2.0.0 Validation
* Load from a semver string or by component
* Intuitive comparison helpers
* Version list sort

Inspiration came from some of these projects:

* @smira [aptly](https://github.com/smira/aptly)
* @mitchellh [go-version](https://github.com/mitchellh/go-version)
* @jm [go-semver](https://github.com/jm/go-semver)
